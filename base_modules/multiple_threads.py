"""
Parallel processing can be achieved in Python in two different ways: 
multiprocessing and threading.

All the threads of a process live in the same memory space, whereas processes 
have their separate memory space.

Threads are more lightweight and have lower overhead compared to processes. 
Spawning processes is a bit slower than spawning threads.

Sharing objects between threads is easier, as they share the same memory space. 
To achieve the same between process, we have to use some kind of IPC (inter-process communication) 
model, typically provided by the OS.
